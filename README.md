 
Hey there ðŸ‘‹! I go by Julez or 5he_Dev.

I'm currently working on T3xNova/Auraâ€”still refining the name, and the project is in its early design phase. 
What you see publicly is just a draft, so feel free to share ideas or suggest features that could make it even better!

My expertise lies in front-end development, UI/UX design, and data analysis, and I'm always exploring ways to push my skills further. 
Letâ€™s build something great together!.
